                    <h3>Reflection 1</h3>
                    <p>i had 2 different themes in my mind so i sketched them out. 
                        <br>the first one is like a windows desktop themes where you can click a folder and a window with contents appears.
                        the second one is a diary theme where the whole content are inside a blank notebook. <br><br>
                        i asked Veerle which theme is better and she said that i should chose anything that represents me, which i ended up choosing the 
                        diary theme. <br><br>
                        i would love to thank Veerle for these comments because i personally thinks that her feedbacks was the reason why i chose this theme.
                    </p>

                <div class="ri1 right1" id="page1_photos">

                <div class="le left1" id="page2" style="display: none;">
                    <h3>Reflection 2</h3>
                    <p>after that one feedback i had with Veerle, i decided to implement them in HTML after making a wireframe. 
                        <br><br> when i tried to make the flipping pages work, i figured that javascript is needed in order to make these idea works.
                        i never knew and learn javascript before so i used ChatGPT to help me. <br><br>
                        it didn't go well. no matter what i asked ChatGPT, none of them works; and it's even worse because i still don't understand how javascript works. <br>
                        so the last thing i could do is ask some teacher about it, then i came to Veerle to discuss. <br><br>
                        she said i needed to simplify and just use HTML and CSS. she also said that my website is quite user friendly but
                        also she gave me some more feedbacks to enhance my website which i'm really grateful.
                    </p>

                <div class="ri1 right1" id="page2_photos" style="display: none;">
                    <h4>Photos:</h4>

                <div class="le left1" id="page3" style="display: none;">
                    <h3>Reflection 3</h3>
                    <p>to be very honest, i don't know what else i could or should put in my website but somehow i feel like my website is quite boring, 
                        since the only you could do is flip the pages and read. <br><br>
                        so i decided to go to another teacher, Robert. 
                        we discussed more possibilities that could upgrade my portfolio. Robert expressed that maybe i can insert more user interactivity by 
                        making a responsive flipping page that are positioned at the corner of the page.
                        <br><br>i think that suggestion is really cool and it would so amazing if i could implement them in my website, but sadly i couldn't with my skills right now.

                    <h3>Reflection 4</h3>
                    <p>a first feedback session with my semester coach, Erwin. he expressed a bunch of positive sides from my website, such as 
                        it looks good and it speaks alot about me, when i heard those i feel quite proud of myself and lowkey boosted my ego. <br>
                        (i don't really remember what other things that he said so i will leave this reflection like this)

                    <h3>Reflection 5</h3>
                    <p>the last time i had feedback with Priyanka, she told me to make a slideshow into my website.
                        <br> and then ofcourse i tried to make them but i encountered an issue where my hoverable image couldn't stay inside the slideshow
                        and i couldn't fix it even though i tried everything. 
                        <br><br> 
                        we talked about it and in the end we decided to not use a slideshow in a section where notebook form are used.
                        <br><br> i also had a problem making my website responsive and i tried to watch some youtube videos to help me understand me better.
                    </p>

                <div class="le left1" id="page6" style="display: none;">
                    <h3>Reflection 6</h3>
                    <p>I decided to chat with my professor about how things are going in class. I let him know I'm a bit worried about passing and asked for some tips. He gave me the lowdown on my website too.
                        <br><br>
                        He pointed out that the responsive design needs a bit more attention and mentioned those hoverable images have too much margin, making the cursor situation a bit uncomfortable. Plus, he reminded me to make sure all the pages are sorted.
                        <br><br>
                        On the bright side, he said I'm doing better than before, which was a relief. So now, I'm going to tweak my website based on his suggestions and hopefully keep those good vibes going in my grades.

                <div class="le left1" id="page7" style="display: none;">
                    <h3>Reflection 7</h3>
                    <p>We talked about the problem with my website, and it turns out I messed up big time by just sticking images without doing the proper HTML coding. That made the site unresponsive. Also, those hoverable images had too much margin, making it a bit annoying for users. We discussed how to do the HTML coding right, and the bottom line is I gotta redo all the pages. I'm crossing my fingers that following Veerle's advice will spruce up and fix my website.</p>
