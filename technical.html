                    <h3>Week 10</h3>
                    <p>  i decided to straight up dive in and make my sketch on prototypes for my portfolio. i also
                        asked for some feedbacks from Veerle
                        about what she thinks on my prototypes. <br><br>
                        to be honest, i barely did anything 
                        on this week beside seeking for inspirations and discussing about our 
                        project with my teammates. <br><br>
                            i’m really happy with my team 
                        because we finished almost all the work (project plan, team charter, etc.) quite ahead than the others. <br><br>
                            i also learned about Gestalt principles on one of my lectures and it was quite fun. i get to understand better on how to design my project page than before. 
                            on the second day of the technical day, i learned about copyright as well as where and how to use a safe and legal resources. this lecture made me decide to put a section special for credits on my images and sources used in my portfolio website.

                    <h3>Week 11</h3>
                    <p>the web development lecture really struck me really hard because i realized that i’m bad at managing my folders;
                        sometimes i faced a problem on my code because my files is put on the wrong folders or either my folder path is a mess. <br>
                    <br>i managed to make my portfolio works the way i want them to be, and i’m quite satisfied with; i used javascript a little bit to make the pages somehow 
                        ‘flip’ but not very dynamically. i didn‘t do much this week because some of my teachers are kept on being sick which i don‘t complain at all.  <br><br>
                        unfortunately, i had a problem connecting to the hera server and SSID was not really helping either. luckily, i asked a help from one of my classmate and we managed to connect it. i was still late to submit the URL but i’m still glad that i, now, can help my friends that are having the same problem.</p>

                <div class="le left1" id="page3" style="display: none;">
                    <h3>Week 12</h3>
                    <p>     This week i‘m focusing on my group project work. My part is to do the login and profile part, including making the prototype and the implementation in both HTML and CSS. <br><br>
                        i made sure to make a clear prototype on Figma and asked feedbacks from my teammates if the layout is good enough or i need to put more. 
                        i, myself, think that it lacks something in it, but i couldn’t grasp what it is; besides, my teammates said it’s already enough so i just leave it as it is. <br><br>
                        the next step is to implement them in our HTML CSS, and honestly it took quite some time because i was struggling with CSS. 
                        i tried my best trying to make it the HTML same as the prototype; i might need to change the color of the boxes but that could be later.<br><br>
                        Next week, i’m planning to put more details on the page after having a meeting with my teammates.</p>

                    <h3>Week 13</h3>
                    <p>    this week i also focused on my project work, i was assigned to do login and signup (register) pages. <br><br>
                        first of all, of course, i made the figma prototype and asked for feedbacks from my teammates and other friends. <br>
                        after all of them agree that the prototype i made is alright, i began to implement them to HTML CSS. <br> <br>
                        the next time i did is i practiced how to use grid flex box after  the technical class. i used some example from W3Schools and they’re really helpful for my learning. at first, i struggled to understand how it works, so i watched some youtube videos to understand more. 
                        <br><br>i also tried to make the flexbox as instructed by one of the teacher, i didn’t struggle as much as i was with grid. i’m planning to use flexbox or grid and apply them to my website.</p>

                <div class="le left1" id="page5" style="display: none;">
                    <h3>Week 14</h3>
                    <p>i didn’t really do much this week since i already made sure that i had finished with my part on our project, so i was just waiting for any feedback from my teammates or teachers. <br><br>
                        i also tried to do a slideshow without javascript and honestly i wasl struggling a lot with it because i feel like the instructions on the canvas slides is not detailed enough to explain which one is doing what; <br>
                        and then i used the youtube tutorial given on canvas. <br> <br>
                        i’m still not sure on how to implement this CSS on my website right now but i will try to use them the next time i have the chances to.

                  <h3>Week 15</h3>
                  
                  <p>this week i don’t feel motivated to do anything because it almost winter break though i had a lecture about responsive design. <br> <br>
                    on the powerpoint it says that we need to find out my target group, which i think the whole idea of my website more fits to PC users because you are able to hover the images to enlarge them automatically. <br><br>
                    personally i think that the it's already too late to tell us that we need to use responsive design when it's almost the end of the semester, i would appreciate it if the module would inform us about this way earlier since it needs a lot of change with what i have right now. <br>
                    but still i will do something about it to make it up.</p>

                <div class="ri right1" id="page6_photos" style="display: none;">
                    
                  <h2>MERRY 
                    <div class="christmas">CHRISTMAS</div> !!</h2>

                <div class="le left1" id="page7" style="display: none;">
                    <h3>Week 16</h3>
                    <p>we had a sudden presentation to one of our technical teacher,  and of course she gave us some feedbacks. on my side, she told me to make the login page (the input email) to be ‘@’ sensitive. 
                        <br><br> 
                        it wasn’t a hard task to do, but when i was done fixing it, i messed up with the responsive design instead.
                        i still haven’t grasp how to do it, so i will need one of my teammates’ help, Nikol. <br><br>
                        i ended up need to change all of my codes because the old version can’t do responsive design or atleast with my skills right now. <br><br>
                        i wished i knew about this sooner so i don’t have to overwork myself (and rush) and no need waste my time making the old version. nonetheless i’m still glad because i get to practice more with grid and flex.
